CRITERION HEADS FOR BANKRUPTCY AS SLEAZY FILM BLOG (that's me) TAKES PREMIER POSITION IN ILL-REPUTED FILM REVIEW WORLD

This Film Blog is proudly sponsored by no-one because I’m a staunch anti-corporate, filthy commie who watches Soviet-era films and yearns for a simpler time when potato was processed for vodka and not clogging up arteries.

That odour you inhale when you enter this site is the smell of cheap weed and frat-boys exclaiming “woah dude, that movie totally spaced my mind, man”.

My only hope with this project is that my sense of stupid, obnoxious and inappropriate satire travels cleanly through the internet, which as I type that - I don’t think that it does.

On a more technical front, the site performs much slower than what I would like and so my very next steps would be to restructure the code to have a much simpler flow - which as I gain experience - becomes much clearer by the day.
